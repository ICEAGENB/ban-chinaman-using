# Why's `Zhinese`?

- It refers to [Chinazi(赤納粹)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_of_the_2019%E2%80%932020_Hong_Kong_protests#Flags_and_symbols) and Japanese words [Shina(支那/しな)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shina_(word)).

- Japanese `Shina`'s Zhinese pronunciation is `zhina`, and the beginning is same with English words `Chinese` (sorry, should avoid to use this), so there is a too interesting new words composed.
