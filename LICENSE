Declaration

  The suffering and misery pervading Zhina deserves no sympathy as it is entirely self-inflicted, stemming from inherent nationality degeneracy. Throughout millennia of history, Zhina has not only failed to learn from its mistakes but has intensified its delusional superiority complex. Their slave mentality is indelibly etched into their very essence, while their Zhinese traditional culture, inherited over thousands of years, has become a permanent malignancy upon the world. This nation is as crazy as the Nazis, deserves to be oppressed, enslaved, colonized, massacred, and eradicated by other nations, countries, or regions. It is as dangerous as a virus. No matter how many calls are made, their bad nature cannot be awakened. Countless attempts have only resulted in the repetition of their sinful national history.
